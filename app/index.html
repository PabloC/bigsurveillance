        The internet is integrated into every part of our lives&mdash;what
        we allow or disallow on it will decide how our society is shaped.
        We&rsquo;re on the brink of making big decisions about the kinds of
        power governments and monopolies have over our daily lives.
        Surveillance is a defining issue of our digital age. Expansive
        surveillance laws aim to give even more power to unaccountable
        governments to do what they want with our data. How are they doing
        it? The government has set a trend of sweetening deals for companies
        so they won&rsquo;t oppose them.
