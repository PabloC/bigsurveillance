<h1>Tech has power <em>over our future</em></h1>

<p class="cta">
    The Internet and the power it gives us has changed the course of history, but runaway governments and monopolies are turning the Internet against us for power and profit. Their biggest move yet -- pass surveillance bill CISA in the next week. We can stop an Internet for evil, but it's now or never.

    <p>
       The US Congress has to hear from us this week or CISA will pass and change the world for the worse. Stop them now.

        We have the power to protect the Internet, but to do that,
        we need to know who is helping us and who is working against us.
