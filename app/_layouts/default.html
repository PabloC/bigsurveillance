<h1>Tech has power <em>over our future</em></h1>

<p class="cta">
    The future could actually suck. Like it's 1984. The powerful can use the
    Internet for evil once CISA passes, a bill that makes companies immune from
    the law if they open the internet to full surveillance by the government.
    It begs the fax.
</p>

<div class="action">
    <p>
        Make big tech say if they oppose CISA and stand by their privacy policy.

    <h2>Political Scoreboard</h2>
    <p>
        We have the power to protect the Internet and ourselves, but to do that,
        everyone has to take a stand and we should know who is on our side.
