<h1>Decide the future <em>of the Internet.</em></h1>

<p class="cta">
    The Internet and the power it gives us has changed the course of history, but runaway governments and monopolies are turning the Internet against us for power and profit. Their biggest move yet: passing the surveillance bill CISA, this week. We can stop an Internet for evil, but it's now or never.

        <p>
           <strong>Tell Congress:</strong> Stop CISA! Protect human rights on the Internet.

    <div id="thanks" style="display: none;">
        <h3>Thanks for taking action!</h3>
        <p>
            We're up against some of the most powerful corporate lobbyists in the country, but that hasn't stopped us before. If a critical mass of citizens speak out against CISA, our voices will be impossible to ignore.
