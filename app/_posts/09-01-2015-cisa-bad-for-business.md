After the Snowden revelations, American companies lost business in countries all over the world. People don't want to be spied on, they want to trust their companies. And, companies all over the world are capitalizing on that. CISA would make it clear to everyone in the world that American companies are surveillance tools for the US government. If American tech equals surveillance, why would you choose them? 

In addition, CISA is a bill that props up monopolies over small businesses. In a truly competitive market, there are low barriers to entry for everyone. But, with no rules on the books including a free pass on fraud and other crimes, it's no holds barred for monopolies to hold onto territory. With no constraints on corpporate giants, smaller companies won't be able to truly compete against them. In addition, CISA undermines trust between companies. Any business you hire or work with might share your data in ways that are bad for your business or your users, without adequate due-process protections and inconsistent with other provisions in the law.
