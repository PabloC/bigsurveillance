After the Snowden revelations, American companies lost business in countries all over the world. People don't want to be spied on, they want to trust their companies. And, companies all over the world are capitalizing on that. CISA would make it clear to everyone in the world that American companies are surveillance tools for the US government. If American tech equals surveillance, why would you choose them? 

In addition, CISA is a bill that props up monopolies over startups. In a truly competitive market, there are low barriers to entry for everyone. But, when monopolies can break any rule on the books, it's no holds barred to holding onto territory, especially with a free pass for fraud or other crimes. Smaller companies trying to get ahead won't be able to truly compete against big bad companies that get away with anything. Talk about a competitive edge!
