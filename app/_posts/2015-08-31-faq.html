    <dt>What is CISA?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            CISA stands for the
            <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754/text" target="_blank">Cybersecurity
                Information Sharing Act</a> of 2015.
        </p>

    </dd>
    <dt>
        Wait, wasn&apos;t there some other bill like that?
    </dt>
    <dd>

        <p>
            Yep, youâ€™re probably thinking of CISPA, which was already
            resoundingly rejected in Congress three times after overwhelming
            public outcry. Here&apos;s a
            <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/congress-cybersecurity-threat-sharing-bills-explained-cisa-cispa-pcna/" target="_blank">good
                comparison</a> of the various bills at play.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Why are they trying again?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Keeping the government&apos;s information secure has come back into
            vogue because of some high-profile exploitations of bad government
            and corporate data practices. While companies have been hacked, like
            Target, the most profound breach we know about was this year&apos;s
            hack of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)&mdash;this is the
            agency that holds the records on federal employees&apos; security
            clearances. That means the most sensitive information about people
            filling some of the most sensitive positions in the federal
            government&mdash;along with tens of millions of others&mdash;have
            been compromised.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of all this, Congress believes it must do
            <em>something</em>&mdash;even if it&apos;s the wrong thing.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>So how does CISA improve cybersecurity?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            It doesn&apos;t.
            <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/files/blogs/technologists_info_sharing_bills_letter_w_exhibit.pdf" target="_blank">Just
                ask the experts.</a> In fact, it appears that Congress
            <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/03/what-ever-it-is-cisa-isnt-cybersecurity.html#.VbKm0Sv9vuP" target="_blank">didn&apos;t
                bother consulting with anyone</a> who knew about
            cybersecurity when drafting this bill.
        </p>

        <p>
            That doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t work to do. While OPM&apos;s
            hack is still being investigated, this attack and almost every other
            one we know about points to a much different culprit: incompetence.
            For instance,
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/attack-gave-chinese-hackers-privileged-access-to-us-systems.html?smid=tw-share&_r=2" target="_blank">using
                the word &ldquo;password&rdquo;</a> as a password.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Then what is CISA really about?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            It allows companies to share your information with the government,
            grants sweeping immunity for companies that do, and, most
            revealingly, requires automated sharing with:
        </p>
        <ul class="departments">
            <li>
                <i class="abc deptcommerce">The Department of Commerce</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="abc deptdefense">The Department of Defense (home of the NSA)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="abc depthomelandsecurity">The Department of Homeland Security</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="abc deptjustice">The Department of Justice (home of the FBI)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="abc depttreasury">The Department of the Treasury</i>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="abc deptodni">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</i>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Is CISA all we have to worry about?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            If only. But our previous victories before set this cybersecurity
            charade back miles&mdash;that is, until the government&apos;s OPM
            incompetence made this a front-page issue again. If you want to see
            the other zombie cybersharing bills shuffling through Congress,
            <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/congress-cybersecurity-threat-sharing-bills-explained-cisa-cispa-pcna/" target="_blank">read
                this.</a>
        </p>

    </dd>
    <dt>Alright, then how do we stop all this?</dt>
    <dd>

        <p>
            By all accounts, CISA is the biggest bully on the playground, and we
            must knock it down. That&apos;s why we&apos;re focusing on it first.
            Our allies on the Hill have made it clear that the biggest problem
            is politicians feel the need to do something. And right now that
            means they&apos;re even willing to vote for a bad bill with terrible
            consequences. They need to hear from you to know this kind of
            bullshit isn&apos;t acceptable.
        </p>

        <p>
            You&apos;ll hear from us again for the next fight. Until then, make
            sure your Senators, your Representatives and your President know you
            don&apos;t support CISA or government spying, and please share this
            page to spread the word!
