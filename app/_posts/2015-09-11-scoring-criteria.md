<p>This project originated in a desire to update EFF's <a href="https://standagainstspying.org">"Stand Against Spying"</a> scorecard covering legislative activity in the 113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. It is a joint project of <a href="https://restorethe4th.com">Restore The Fourth</a> and <a href="https://fightforthefuture.org">Fight for the Future</a>.</p>
<p>
We decided early on that, like with "Stand Against Spying", the scorecard should be objective: That is, it should not contain value judgments about the quality or trustworthiness of legislators' public statements on mass surveillance, or about how the legislator was generally perceived to stand on that issue, but should consider only the votes they actually took, and decisions to sponsor or cosponsor legislation introduced in Congress.
 </p>

<h3>Coding Votes on the USA FREEDOM Act</h3>

<p>The major challenge for a surveillance scorecard is interpreting votes on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Votes on this Act were not a clear signal of being for or against surveillance reform. For many organizations, including ours, and for many legislators as well, the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak and limited to represent any kind of surveillance reform, and also modernized certain powers of the surveillance state. Its passage even posed a risk of derailing real surveillance reform by enabling legislators to make the political claim that it had dealt with the problem of mass surveillance. A Yes vote on the USA FREEDOM Act could therefore potentially mean that the legislator thought that it was a good, if incremental, step towards reform; but it could also, as it turned out for some legislators, be thought of as the most feasible way to preserve surveillance authorities against the threat of the outright expiration of Section 215. A No vote could mean that the legislator thought the USA FREEDOM Act didn't go nearly far enough; but it could also mean that the legislator could not accept even its very weak reforms, and felt that Congress should not restrict surveillance authorities at all.</p>
<p>In consequence, we needed some objective indicator of a legislator's underlying desire for surveillance reform, in order to assign points correctly to their votes on the USA FREEDOM Act. For the Senate, we found an indicator, in the form of the Senate's vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. If a Senator voted Yes on straight reauthorization, that was a much clearer indicator that they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever, and therefore that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it was because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA FREEDOM Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak. For the former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as -4 points; for the latter group, we coded the same vote as +4 points. In the House, we went back to EFF's "Stand Against Spying" scorecard and analyzed the grades of the 88 House members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and found that in almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard were very high. Consequently, we felt comfortable coding all House No votes on USA FREEDOM as +4. After much discussion, we felt that most legislators voting Yes on USA FREEDOM in either chamber probably voted Yes because they felt it was a positive step towards reform, so we coded such votes as +1.
</p>
<p>For the prior votes on the 2014 version of USA FREEDOM, we adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it was gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.
</p>
<h3>Coding Other Votes and Cosponsorships
</h3>
<p>The rest of the coding was relatively straightforward. Voting for or cosponsoring measures that advanced surveillance reform gained points for the legislator; voting against such measures, or cosponsoring anti-reform measures, lost points for the legislator. The number of points gained or lost represents our collective value judgement as to how much the measure, if passed, would advance the overall project of surveillance reform. For example, the wholesale repeal of the surveillance state represented by the Surveillance State Repeal Acts of 2014 and 2015 merit four points each; the FISA Reform Act of 2015, briefly introduced as an attempt to provide a weaker substitute for the USA FREEDOM Act, merits -3 points.
</p>

<h3><strong>Summary of Points Allocation</strong></h3>

<p> As further relevant votes come up, such as those on CISA, we will add them to our points system. At the beginning of the 116th Congress, we intend to remove the point allocations for the 113th Congress, to keep the scorecard relevant to legislators' recent activity.

<h3>Reporting Accurately on Surveillance Reform
</h3>

<p>This project threw up several important findings relevant to journalists reporting on surveillance, and to members of the public deciding how to vote and whom to fund.</p>

<p>First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to your legislator's stance on mass surveillance. We find a few Democrats with Fs (Langevin, Sewell) and many Republicans with A+ (Duncan, Gohmert). Strong liberals are fairly unified in their support for surveillance reform, but strong conservatives are deeply divided between a homeland-security emphasis and a constitutional-liberties emphasis. So while not entirely useless, party affiliation is highly unreliable, and journalists should steer clear of identifying a party-based stance on surveillance in their reporting.</p>

<p>
Second, reporters should not treat the reforms in the USA FREEDOM Act as being the most radical reform measures in Congress. The scorecard includes many examples of stronger reforms that have garnered substantial support. As we move forward into discussions of reforms to the much more abusive Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, which sunsets in June 2017, it will be worth bearing in mind the substantial, bipartisan set of legislators who never intended reform efforts to stop with the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act.
 </p>

<p>Third, the data does provide some guidance as to who in Congress is more likely to support reform. Having a military background, serving on an intelligence committee, being in leadership and being from the South seems to be associated with hostility to surveillance reform (an exemplar here being Tom Cotton); being African-American, being recently elected, identifying with Ron Paul, or being from the Pacific Northwest, Upper Midwest or Northeast, seems to be associated with support of surveillance reform. Itâ€™s not just a story about Rand Paul and his presidential ambitions; surveillance reformers include many legislators from many backgrounds. There is also usually substantial variation within states that argues against easy conclusions. In key 2016 races around the country, the candidates running from both parties have sharply different positions on surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that this will change in future cycles.</p>
