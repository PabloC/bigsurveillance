### Project History and Cosponsors

This scorecard is a joint project of [Restore The
Fourth](https://restorethe4th.com) and [Fight for the
Future](https://fightforthefuture.org).

The scorecard is objective, rather than qualitative. That is, scores are based
on actual votes and legislative action such as co-sponsorships rather
than the quality or trustworthiness of legislators' public action or
statements on mass
surveillance.

v. 1.0 of this Scorecard was EFF’s [Stand Against
Spying](https://standagainstspying.org)
v. 2.0 launched September 29, 2015, and scored Congressional votes
on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 and FISA reform bills not included in
v. 1.0.
v. 2.1 launched October 29, 2015, and added Congressional votes on
cybersecurity bills (CISA, PCNA and NCPAA) and ECPA reform.


#### **Summary of Points Allocations and Grade Boundaries**

As further relevant votes come up, they will be added to the points system.

##### 113th Congress (2013-14):

Sponsored or cosponsored S. 1551, IOSRA (Yes = +4)
Sponsored or cosponsored FISA Improvements Act (Yes = -4)
Sponsored or cosponsored FISA Transparency & Modernization Act (Yes = -4)
Sponsored or cosponsored Surveillance State Repeal Act (2014 or
2015) (Yes = +4)
Sponsored or cosponsored USA FREEDOM 2014 prior to 2014-05-18 (Yes =
+2) - Before this date, USA FREEDOM was a substantially stronger piece
of legislation, meriting +2 rather than +1.
Voted for Conyers/Amash amendment (Yes = +4)
Voted for House version of USA FREEDOM 2014 (Yes = -2) This gutted
version of USA FREEDOM was weaker than what eventually passed in the
114th Congress, meriting -2 points.
Voted for Massie-Lofgren amendment 2014 (Yes = +3)

##### 114th Congress (2015-16):

Sponsored or cosponsored whistleblower protection for IC
employees/contractors (Yes = +4)
1st USA FREEDOM 2015 cloture vote (Yes = +1, No = +4 or = -4
conditional on straight reauth vote)
Straight reauth (Yes = -3)
Sponsored or cosponsored FISA Reform Act (Yes = -3)
Amendment 1449 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Data retention (No = +1, Yes = -3)
Amendment 1450 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Extend implementation to 1yr (No
= +1, Yes = -2)
Amendment 1451 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Gut amicus (No = +1, Yes = -3)
Final passage USA FREEDOM 2015 (Yes = +1, No = +4 or = -4
conditional on straight reauth vote)
House vote on PCNA (Yes = -3, No = +3)
House vote on NCPAA (Yes = -2, No = +2)
Massie-Lofgren amendment to HR2685: Defund 702 (Yes = +3/No = -3)
Massie-Lofgren amendment on HR4870: No Encryption Backdoors (Yes = +3/No = -3)
Senate vote for cloture on CISA (Yes = -4, No = +4)
Senate vote on Franken amendment to CISA (narrowing definition of
cybersecurity threat) (Yes = +2/No = -1)
Senate vote on Wyden amendment to CISA (companies must scrub
personal data) (Yes = +2/No = -1)
Senate vote on Heller amendment to CISA (DHS must scrub personal
data) (Yes = +1/No = -1)
Senate vote on Coons amendment to CISA (limit information sharing to
that necessary to describe or identify a cybersecurity threat) (Yes =
+1/No = -1)
Senate vote on Cotton amendment (removes liability for bypassing DHS
to share data with FBI and Secret Service) (Yes = -2/No = +1)
Cosponsored ECPA reform bill in 114th Congress (Yes = +2)
Sponsored or cosponsored bill proposing Section 702 reforms in 114th
Congress (Yes = +4)

We set the grade boundaries unevenly, because the legislators are
themselves distributed unevenly. The buckets are generally narrower in
the middle of the distribution than at either end.


### Methodological Issues in Allocating Points

Two notable difficulties that arose when formulating the scorecard
were how to interpret votes on the USA FREEDOM Act, and how to score
amendments.

Votes on USA FREEDOM 2015 were not a clear signal of being for or
against surveillance reform. For many organizations, including ours,
and for many legislators as well, the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak
and limited to represent any kind of surveillance reform, and also
modernized certain powers of the surveillance state. Its passage even
posed a risk of derailing real surveillance reform by enabling
legislators to make the political claim that it had dealt with the
problem of mass surveillance. For those reasons, we choose to score a
Yes vote at -1. However, a No vote could mean that the legislator
thought the USA FREEDOM Act didn't go nearly far enough; but it could
also mean that the legislator could not accept even its very weak
reforms, and felt that Congress should not restrict surveillance
authorities at all. We therefore tied No votes in the Senate to the
legislator’s vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of
Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. A Yes on straight reauthorization
indicated clearly that they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever,
and therefore that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it
was because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator
voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA FREEDOM
Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak. For the
former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as -4 points; for the
latter group, we coded the same vote as +4 points. In the House, we
went back to EFF's "Stand Against Spying" scorecard and analyzed the
grades of the 88 House members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and
found that in almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard
were very high. Consequently, we felt comfortable coding all House No
votes on USA FREEDOM as +4. For prior votes on the 2014 version of USA
FREEDOM, we adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it
was gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.

Scoring amendments to CISA posed complexities. We strongly oppose CISA
as a surveillance bill. Many amendments were offered, and that raised
the problem that legislators might vote for CISA on cloture (-4) and
on final passage (-4), but might vote in favor of all
anti-surveillance amendments, and thereby come out ahead on net. We
dealt with this by not scoring the Leahy amendment (relating to FOIA
exemptions) and by allocating points such that a legislator like this
would come out slightly behind on points.

#### Reporting Accurately on Surveillance Reform

This project threw up several important findings relevant to journalists
reporting on surveillance, and to members of the public deciding how to vote and
whom to fund.

First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to your
legislator's stance on mass surveillance. We find a few Democrats with Fs and
many Republicans with A+. So while not entirely useless, party affiliation is
highly unreliable, and journalists should steer clear of identifying a
party-based stance on surveillance in their reporting.

Second, reporters should not treat the reforms in the USA FREEDOM Act as being
the most radical reform measures in Congress. The scorecard includes many
examples of stronger reforms that have garnered substantial support. As we move
forward into discussions of reforms to the much more abusive Section 702 of the
FISA Amendments Act, which sunsets in June 2017, it will be worth bearing in
mind the substantial, bipartisan set of legislators who never intended reform
efforts to stop with the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act.

Third, the data does provide some guidance as to who in Congress is more likely
to support reform. There is also usually substantial variation within states
that argues against easy conclusions. In key 2016 races around the country, the
candidates running from both parties have sharply different positions on
surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that this will change in future
cycles.
