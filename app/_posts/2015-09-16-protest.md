<p>
    Bring your bodies, phones, and signs to the corner of 1st St. NE and East Capitol this Thursday at 6:30PM (a few blocks from the Capitol South metro station). We will gather as it gets dark, hold lit up signs and phones to show that people are absolutely opposed to expanding mass surveillance capabilities and and watch/prosecute lists for things like "fake id's", while also incentivizing bad network security.
